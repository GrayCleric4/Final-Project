Descripition/Links to datasets:

Arrest Data:

Description: The data is the Pittsburgh polices records of local Pittsburgh arrests.  The data has basics details of the crime including 
the location, age of criminal, crime commited, time of day, etc.

Property Data:

The second metric was the average property sale value for each Pittsburgh zip code since 2013. The data includes all property transaction values, including transactions well below the fair market value of the property. For example, some recorded transactions involved the sale of property for $1, which would bring down the mean property value for that zip code because property is relatively expensive. After filtering transactions below $1,000, the sold prices were grouped by zip code and then averaged. To combine with the other two datasets, a points system was implemented that assigns 5 points to the top 20th percentile, 4 points to the top 40th percentile, and so on. Both other datasets use a similar points system to give equal weight to each factor.

Restaurant Data:

This data set is a set of all of the restaurants in Allegheny County with geographic locations including zip code, size, description of use, and a "status" of either 1 or 7 to indicate if the restaurant is currently open.

Abstract: (summary of findings- What is the best neighborhood? How did you determine it? Brief summary of metrics)
-decide what neighborhood is best - We decided that Squirrel Hill is the best overrall.  
-explain metrics - 20% scale in which the top 20% for a given dataset is a 5.  Total points possible for a given neighborhood
with this system is 15 points across the 3 datasets.
